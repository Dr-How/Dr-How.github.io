Welcome to my academic page!

## About me

I am a post-doc on discrete geometry, recently moved to Discrete Mathematics
section at [Technishce Universiteit Eindhoven](http://www.tue.nl), Netherlands,
for a short visit.

I obtained my Dr.\ rer.\ nat.\ in Aug 2014 at [Freie Universität
Berlin](http://www.fu-berlin.de/) in Germany, under the supervision of Prof.
[Günter M. Ziegler](http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/gmziegler/). Before that, I was
a polytechnicien at [Ecole Polytechnique](http://www.polytechnique.fr) in
France, where I begin my adventure in mathematics.  Initially I studied physics
for my bachelor at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn) and
part of my master at [Ecole Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr).  See my
[CV](./documents/CV.pdf).

I was born in Shanghai.   My mother languages are Mandarin and Wu.  I also
speak English and French, and can communicate with German.  I'm married and my
wife is currently a chemical physicist at Max Planck Institut.  I maintain
a moderate presence on
[MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/users/20595/hao-chen) and a very weak
presence on other social networks.

## Research

My research interest is [discrete
geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry).  It lies in the
intersection of combinatorics and geometry, and also connects to algebra.

The topic of my
[thesis](http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/diss/receive/FUDISS_thesis_000000097216)[![PDF][pdf]](./documents/Thesis.pdf)
is the combinatorics of non-congruent ball packings in higher dimensions.  The
main object of study is the tangency graph of ball packings.  The motivation is
[Koebe–Andreev–Thurston’s disk packing
theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing_theorem).  My thesis made
a contribution to the understanding of higher dimensional ball packings.  My
research diverges into many branches of discrete geometry and geometric group
theory, including distance geometry, polytope theory, geometric representation
of graphs, coding theory, hyperplane arrangement and Coxeter groups.  This
opens many possibilities for future research.

For my post-doctoral research, I continued on hyperbolic Coxeter groups, made
some progress on the chromatic problem of ball packings, and also worked on
scribability problems.  Currently I'm working on nested simplices and
non-negative factorizations of matrices, and also jointed a project about three
periodic minimal surfaces.

@. [*Selectively Balancing Unit Vectors*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00493-016-3635-z)
	[![arXiv][arxiv]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05121)
	[![PDF][pdf]](./documents/Balancing.pdf) (online 2017)  
	on **Combinatorica**
	with [Aart Blokhuis][aart]

	We prove that, to asymptotically nlogn/2 unit vectors of dimension n,
	one can assign positive, negative or zero signs, such that the signed
	sum of the vectors has a Euclidean norm smaller than 1.  This is
	however not possible, asymptotically, with less unit vectors.

@. [*Even more infinite ball packings from Lorentzian Coxeter systems*](http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v23i3p16)
	[![arXiv][arxiv]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2439)
	[![PDF][pdf]](./documents/MorePack.pdf)  
	on **The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics** (2016)

	Boyd-Maxwell ball packings are generalized to Lorentzian root systems
	where the simple roots are only required to be positively independent.
	This leads to many more infinite ball packings, as we partially
	enumerated in the paper.  Source code available
	[here](https://github.com/Dr-How/L2Graph).

@. [*Apollonian ball packings and stacked polytopes*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00454-016-9777-3)
	[![arXiv][arxiv]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2515)
	[![PDF][pdf]](./documents/Stacked.pdf)  
	on **Discrete and Computational Geometry** (2016)

	The relation between stacked polytopes and Apollonian ball packings is
	investigated.  It is proved that the skeleton of a stacked 4-polytope is
	3-ball packable if an only if there is no six 4-cliques sharing a 3-clique.
	Partial results are obtained in higher dimensions.

@. [*Distance geometry for kissing spheres*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.laa.2015.04.012)

	[![PDF][pdf]](./documents/DistGeom.pdf)  
	on **Linear Algebra and its Applications** (2015)

	I define a Möbius-invariant distance function for the set of kissing
	spheres and studied the associated distance geometry.  It turns out to be
	a generalization of the Classical Euclidean distance geometry.

@. [*Lorentzian Coxeter systems and Boyd–Maxwell ball packings*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10711-014-0004-1)

	on **Geometriae Dedicata** (2014)
	with [Jean-Philippe Labbé][labbe]

	We revisit the work of Boyd (1974) and Maxwell (1982) on infinite ball
	packings and relate them to the recent studies of limit roots.  In
	particular, we publish the complete list of 326 Coxeter groups of level 2.
	An extended abstract appeared in the [Proceeding of FPSAC
	2014](http://www.dmtcs.org/dmtcs-ojs/index.php/proceedings/article/view/dmAT0110).
	[Here](https://github.com/Dr-How/L2Graph) is the
	[Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/) code for enumerating Coxeter graphs of
	level 2.  This work was cited on [this Wikipedia
	page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter%E2%80%93Dynkin_diagram#Lorentzian_groups).

	[![PDF][pdf]](./documents/TreeLapl.pdf)

	with [Jürgen Jost][jost]
	
	We investigate the structural information of trees encoded by the
	eigenvalue 1 of the normalized Laplacian. This work was done during my
	research internship at [MPI for maths in sciences](http://www.mis.mpg.de).
